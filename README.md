# PONG_game

This is a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the turtle module. The game allows two players to compete against each other by controlling a paddle and hitting a ball back and forth. The objective of the game is to score points by making the ball go past the opponent's paddle. The game includes a simple user interface with a black background and white objects. It also features sound effects for when the ball hits a paddle or the wall. The code is easy to read and understand, making it a good starting point for anyone interested in learning Python game development.
